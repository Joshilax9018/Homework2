 <h1> <i> Welcome to DownTown Cafe</i> </h1> 
 <h2> <b> Proudly serving since 1958 </b> </h2>
 <p> There's nothing cookie-cutter about Downtown Cafe.Not our pizzas.Not our people.And
 definately not the way we live life.Around here,we don't settle for anything less than food
 we're proud to serve.And we don't just clock in.Not when we can also become our best,make
 friends,and have fun while we're at it.
